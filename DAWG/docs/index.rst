DAWG documentation
==================

This package provides DAWG(DAFSA_)-based dictionary-like
read-only objects for Python (2.x and 3.x).

String data in a DAWG may take 200x less memory than in
a standard Python dict and the raw lookup speed is comparable;
it also provides fast advanced methods like prefix search.

Based on `dawgdic`_ C++ library.

Installation
============

From `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/DAWG>`_::

    pip install DAWG

Usage
=====

There are several DAWG classes in this package:

* ``dawg.DAWG`` - basic DAWG wrapper; it can store unicode keys
  and do exact lookups;

* ``dawg.CompletionDAWG`` - ``dawg.DAWG`` subclass that supports
  key completion and prefix lookups (but requires more memory);

* ``dawg.BytesDAWG`` - ``dawg.CompletionDAWG`` subclass that
  maps unicode keys to lists of ``bytes`` objects.

* ``dawg.RecordDAWG`` - ``dawg.BytesDAWG`` subclass that
  maps unicode keys to lists of data tuples.
  All tuples must be of the same format (the data is packed
  using python ``struct`` module).

* ``dawg.IntDAWG`` - ``dawg.DAWG`` subclass that maps unicode keys
  to integer values.

* ``dawg.IntCompletionDAWG`` - ``dawg.CompletionDAWG`` subclass
  that maps unicode keys to integer values.

DAWG and CompletionDAWG
-----------------------

``DAWG`` and ``CompletionDAWG`` are useful when you need
fast & memory efficient simple string storage. These classes
does not support assigning values to keys.

``DAWG`` and ``CompletionDAWG`` constructors accept an iterable with keys::

    >>> import dawg
    >>> words = [u'foo', u'bar', u'foobar', u'foö', u'bör']
    >>> base_dawg = dawg.DAWG(words)
    >>> completion_dawg = dawg.CompletionDAWG(words)

It is then possible to check if the key is in a DAWG::

    >>> u'foo' in base_dawg
    True
    >>> u'baz' in completion_dawg
    False

It is possible to find all keys that starts with a given
prefix in a ``CompletionDAWG``::

    >>> completion_dawg.keys(u'foo')
    >>> [u'foo', u'foobar']

to test whether some key begins with a given prefix::

    >>> completion_dawg.has_keys_with_prefix(u'foo')
    >>> True

and to find all prefixes of a given key::

    >>> base_dawg.prefixes(u'foobarz')
    [u'foo', u'foobar']

Iterator versions are also available::

    >>> for key in completion_dawg.iterkeys(u'foo'):
    ...     print(key)
    foo
    foobar
    >>> for prefix in base_dawg.iterprefixes(u'foobarz'):
    ...     print(prefix)
    foo
    foobar

It is possible to find all keys similar to a given key (using a one-way
char translation table)::

    >>> replaces = dawg.DAWG.compile_replaces({u'o': u'ö'})
    >>> base_dawg.similar_keys(u'foo', replaces)
    [u'foo', u'foö']
    >>> base_dawg.similar_keys(u'foö', replaces)
    [u'foö']
    >>> base_dawg.similar_keys(u'bor', replaces)
    [u'bör']

BytesDAWG
---------

``BytesDAWG`` is a ``CompletionDAWG`` subclass that can store
binary data for each key.

``BytesDAWG`` constructor accepts an iterable with
``(unicode_key, bytes_value)`` tuples::

    >>> data = [(u'key1', b'value1'), (u'key2', b'value2'), (u'key1', b'value3')]
    >>> bytes_dawg = dawg.BytesDAWG(data)

There can be duplicate keys; all unique values are stored in this case::

    >>> bytes_dawg[u'key1']
    [b'value1, b'value3']

For unique keys a list with a single value is returned for consistency::

    >>> bytes_dawg[u'key2']
    [b'value2']

``KeyError`` is raised for missing keys; use ``get`` method if you need
a default value instead::

    >>> bytes_dawg.get(u'foo', None)
    None

``BytesDAWG`` support ``keys``, ``items``, ``iterkeys`` and ``iteritems``
methods (they all accept optional key prefix). There is also support for
``similar_keys``, ``similar_items`` and ``similar_item_values`` methods.

RecordDAWG
----------

``RecordDAWG`` is a ``BytesDAWG`` subclass that automatically
packs & unpacks the binary data from/to Python objects
using ``struct`` module from the standard library.

First, you have to define a format of the data. Consult Python docs
(http://docs.python.org/library/struct.html#format-strings) for the format
string specification.

For example, let's store 3 short unsigned numbers (in a Big-Endian byte order)
as values::

    >>> format = ">HHH"

``RecordDAWG`` constructor accepts an iterable with
``(unicode_key, value_tuple)``. Let's create such iterable
using ``zip`` function::

    >>> keys = [u'foo', u'bar', u'foobar', u'foo']
    >>> values = [(1, 2, 3), (2, 1, 0), (3, 3, 3), (2, 1, 5)]
    >>> data = zip(keys, values)
    >>> record_dawg = RecordDAWG(format, data)

As with ``BytesDAWG``, there can be several values for the same key::

    >>> record_dawg['foo']
    [(1, 2, 3), (2, 1, 5)]
    >>> record_dawg['foobar']
    [(3, 3, 3)]


BytesDAWG and RecordDAWG implementation details
-----------------------------------------------

``BytesDAWG`` and ``RecordDAWG`` stores data at the end of the keys::

    <utf8-encoded key><separator><base64-encoded data>

Data is encoded to base64 because dawgdic_ C++ library doesn't allow
zero bytes in keys (it uses null-terminated strings) and such keys are
very likely in binary data.

In DAWG versions prior to 0.5 ``<separator>`` was ``chr(255)`` byte.
It was chosen because keys are stored as UTF8-encoded strings and
``chr(255)`` is guaranteed not to appear in valid UTF8, so the end of
text part of the key is not ambiguous.

But ``chr(255)`` was proven to be problematic: it changes the order
of the keys. Keys are naturally returned in lexicographical order by DAWG.
But if ``chr(255)`` appears at the end of each text part of a key then the
visible order would change. Imagine ``'foo'`` key with some payload
and ``'foobar'`` key with some payload. ``'foo'`` key would be greater
than ``'foobar'`` key: values compared would be ``'foo<sep>'`` and ``'foobar<sep>'``
and ``ord(<sep>)==255`` is greater than ``ord(<any other character>)``.

So now the default ``<separator>`` is chr(1). This is the lowest allowed
character and so it preserves the alphabetical order.

It is not strictly correct to use chr(1) as a separator because chr(1)
is a valid UTF8 character. But I think in practice this won't be an issue:
such control character is very unlikely in text keys, and binary keys
are not supported anyway because dawgdic_ doesn't support keys containing
chr(0).

If you can't guarantee chr(1) is not a part of keys, lexicographical order
is not important to you or there is a need to read
a ``BytesDAWG``/``RecordDAWG`` created by DAWG < 0.5 then pass
``payload_separator`` argument to the constructor::

    >>> BytesDAWG(payload_separator=b'\xff').load('old.dawg')

The storage scheme has one more implication: values of ``BytesDAWG``
and ``RecordDAWG`` are also sorted lexicographically.

For ``RecordDAWG`` there is a gotcha: in order to have meaningful
ordering of numeric values store them in big-endian format::

    >>> data = [('foo', (3, 2, 256)), ('foo', (3, 2, 1)), ('foo', (3, 2, 3))]
    >>> d = RecordDAWG("3H", data)
    >>> d.items()
    [(u'foo', (3, 2, 256)), (u'foo', (3, 2, 1)), (u'foo', (3, 2, 3))]

    >>> d2 = RecordDAWG(">3H", data)
    >>> d2.items()
    [(u'foo', (3, 2, 1)), (u'foo', (3, 2, 3)), (u'foo', (3, 2, 256))]

IntDAWG and IntCompletionDAWG
-----------------------------

``IntDAWG`` is a ``{unicode -> int}`` mapping. It is possible to
use ``RecordDAWG`` for this, but ``IntDAWG`` is natively
supported by dawgdic_ C++ library and so ``__getitem__`` is much faster.

Unlike ``BytesDAWG`` and ``RecordDAWG``, ``IntDAWG`` doesn't support
having several values for the same key.

``IntDAWG`` constructor accepts an iterable with (unicode_key, integer_value)
tuples::

    >>> data = [ (u'foo', 1), (u'bar', 2) ]
    >>> int_dawg = dawg.IntDAWG(data)

It is then possible to get a value from the IntDAWG::

    >>> int_dawg[u'foo']
    1

``IntCompletionDAWG`` supports all ``IntDAWG`` and ``CompletionDAWG`` methods,
plus ``.items()`` and ``.iteritems()``.

Persistence
-----------

All DAWGs support saving/loading and pickling/unpickling.

Write DAWG to a stream::

    >>> with open('words.dawg', 'wb') as f:
    ...     d.write(f)

Save DAWG to a file::

    >>> d.save('words.dawg')

Load DAWG from a file::

    >>> d = dawg.DAWG()
    >>> d.load('words.dawg')

.. warning::

    Reading DAWGs from streams and unpickling are currently using 3x memory
    compared to loading DAWGs using ``load`` method; please avoid them until
    the issue is fixed.

Read DAWG from a stream::

    >>> d = dawg.RecordDAWG(format_string)
    >>> with open('words.record-dawg', 'rb') as f:
    ...     d.read(f)

DAWG objects are picklable::

    >>> import pickle
    >>> data = pickle.dumps(d)
    >>> d2 = pickle.loads(data)

Benchmarks
==========

For a list of 3000000 (3 million) Russian words memory consumption
with different data structures (under Python 2.7):

* dict(unicode words -> word lenghts): about 600M
* list(unicode words) : about 300M
* ``marisa_trie.RecordTrie`` : 11M
* ``marisa_trie.Trie``: 7M
* ``dawg.DAWG``: 2M
* ``dawg.CompletionDAWG``: 3M
* ``dawg.IntDAWG``: 2.7M
* ``dawg.RecordDAWG``: 4M


.. note::

    Lengths of words were not stored as values in ``dawg.DAWG``,
    ``dawg.CompletionDAWG`` and ``marisa_trie.Trie`` because they don't
    support this.

.. note::

    `marisa-trie`_ is often more more memory efficient than
    DAWG (depending on data); it can also handle larger datasets
    and provides memory-mapped IO, so don't dismiss `marisa-trie`_
    based on this README file. It is still several times slower than
    DAWG though.

Please take this benchmark results with a grain of salt; this

Current limitations
===================

* ``IntDAWG`` is currently a subclass of ``DAWG`` and so it doesn't
  support ``keys()`` and ``items()`` methods;
* ``read()`` method reads the whole stream (DAWG must be the last or the
  only item in a stream if it is read with ``read()`` method) - pickling
  doesn't have this limitation;
* DAWGs loaded with ``read()`` and unpickled DAWGs uses 3x-4x memory
  compared to DAWGs loaded with ``load()`` method;
* there are ``keys()`` and ``items()`` methods but no ``values()`` method;
* iterator versions of methods are not always implemented;
* ``BytesDAWG`` and ``RecordDAWG`` has a limitation: values
  larger than 8KB are unsupported;
* the maximum number of DAWG units is limited: number of DAWG units
  (and thus transitions - but not elements) should be less than 2^29;
  this mean that it may be impossible to build an especially huge DAWG
  (you may split your data into several DAWGs or try `marisa-trie`_ in
  this case).

Contributions are welcome!

How is source code organized
----------------------------

There are 4 folders in repository:

* ``bench`` - benchmarks & benchmark data;
* ``lib`` - original unmodified `dawgdic`_ C++ library and
  a customized version of `libb64`_ library. They are bundled
  for easier distribution; if something is have to be fixed in these
  libraries consider fixing it in the original repositories;
* ``src`` - wrapper code; ``src/dawg.pyx`` is a wrapper implementation;
  ``src/*.pxd`` files are Cython headers for corresponding C++ headers;
  ``src/*.cpp`` files are the pre-built extension code and shouldn't be
  modified directly (they should be updated via ``update_cpp.sh`` script).
* ``tests`` - the test suite.
